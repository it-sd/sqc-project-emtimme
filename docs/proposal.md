BookWorm
========

For my project I am going to createa  website where people can read and write books. They will be able to save books 
in to a library for later reading. They can also write their own books right in the website. Users will be able to create 
an account for the website so that their library and stories are saved. They will be able to search the website by 
book titles or tags. For assistance there will be a help page that will lead them to a form to contact someone for 
assistance. 

Web Service
-----------

I will be using the [Micro User Service](https://m3o.com/user) API web service in my website to allow users to create 
and manage their accounts. 

I am not sure how to find the end points on the webstie. I need to look in to this further. 

Database
--------

In my database I will need to read and write log in information such as email, username, DOB, password, and name. I will need to read and write information for the stories such as the text, title, chapter, keywords, and rating. I will also need to read this story information when users want to read a story but they will not be able to edit it.
